# cryptomata
cryptographic algorithm attempt based on cellullar automata and feistel

## I'm not an expert in the field of cryptography, it's a project made for fun, not for production. Use it for educational purposes only.

------------------------

Usage:

* `./cryptomata [value] [key1] ... [keyN]`

Exemple:

* `./cryptomata thisisanexample thisisasamplekey1 thisisasecondkey thisisathirdkey`

Note that the program need at least one value and one key to work

-------------------

Other things to know (it's useless but i like it):
* `make` Build the program and run directly a test
* `make compile` Build the program
* `make run` run a test without compiling
* `make randrun` run a test with randomized keys
